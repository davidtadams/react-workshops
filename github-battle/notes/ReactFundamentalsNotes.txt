React Ecosystem Video
Imperative -> telling program how to do something
Declarative -> telling program what you want to do
  more concerned about what we want to do rather than how we want to do it
  more of an abstraction
  more functional programming
    - reduces side effects
    - minimizes mutability
    - more readable once you get the hang of the way the code works

React is mostly declarative
takes the state outside of the DOM and into the React component
the argument that react is declarative comes mostly from its components
  - the components represent a declarative paradigm

Composition
  - breaking everything down into a component
  - you can compose larger components out of smaller components

Mutations
  - you have to explicitly change state
  - in react this is only with SetState

This Course
- React
- React Router
- Webpack
- Babel
- Axios

Any new tool, always ask
1. Why does this exist?
2. What problem is it solving?


Getting started
$ npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin webpack webpack-dev-server babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-react

Pure functions
- consistency and predictability
- always return the same result given the same input (args)
- execution doesn't depend on the state of the application
- don't modify variables outside of the scope of the function (no side effects)

JS
- slice is a pure function
- splice is not (it mutates the array)

React render method
like F(d)=V
function takes data and gives you a view

React components
FIRST
Focused
Independent
Reusable
Small
Testable

Stateless Functional Components
- just a function that is stateless and
- takes the place of a react component with just a render method

Presentational vs Container Components

Presentational components are stateless
Presentational just takes in some data and renders a view
example
function HelloWorld (props) {
  return (
    <div>Hello {props.name}</div>
  )
}

Stateless Functional Components do not support shouldComponentUpdate

React PropTypes
- can use React.PropTypes to check the type of a prop coming into a component
for functions -> propTypes.func
for booleans -> propTypes.bool
